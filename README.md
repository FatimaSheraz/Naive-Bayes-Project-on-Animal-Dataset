# Naive-Bayes-Project-on-Animal-Dataset
**Naive Bayes** is a simple and fast machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, especially in text analysis. It works on Bayes’ Theorem and assumes that features (words) are independent of each other. Despite this “naive” assumption, it performs well in spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document classification.
